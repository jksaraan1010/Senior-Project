      Welcome to My Transition Explorer. We hope you enjoy using this application. Below are the Modules!
      <br><br>
      <p>
         Dear Admin,
         <br>
         This page will serve as a guide to the different pages in the application.
      </p>
      <br>         
      <h2> Dashboard </h2>
      <p>This is the home page of the application. Everytime you login you
         will land in this page. On the top you will see a Menu. The menu will 
         open a side bar in which you can click on a specific page, and you will
         be taken to that page. You will also see a home icon which is available
         in every page. Clicking this icon will return you back to the dashboard.
         Next to the home icon is the logout icon. Once you click this icon,
         you are logged out of the account. It is best to close your browser
         once you've logged out of the application.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2> User Profile </h2>
      <p>The user profile page is the page to go to when you need to update 
         your username or password.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2> User Guide </h2>
      <p>Similar to this page, the user guide will serve as a guide to the 
         different pages in the application.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2> Assessment- Take Assessment </h2>
      <p>The transition Assessment is a simple and easy to understand Assessment which focuses on
         three main areas in your transition: 
      <ul>
         <li> Self-Care.</li>
         <li> Health Awareness.</li>
         <li> Communication. </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p> The Assessment consists of 12 questions, and should be taken once every 3-6 months.</p>
      <p> As an admin you will get access to the assessment to view it
         -as the user will see it- while updating it.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>  Timeline </h2>
      <p>Milestones help keep us on track! The timeline serves as a milestone guiding 
         tracker in the following three areas:

         <li> Health Awareness.</li>
         <li> Communication. </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p> The timeline milestones categorize the transition to adult care in three age 
         categories:

      <br>
      <h2>  Questions  </h2>
